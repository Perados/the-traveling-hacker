There are hundreds of humanitarian projects around the world where you can use your IT skills to help. And even without any it skills, you can still help by volunteering or donating money.
I decided to write this article about these two particular projects because I met their founder last month in Chiang Mai, Thailand. What I lived there exceeded my expectations.

I am currently working in Bangkok, and went to Chiang Mai last November, for the Loi Krathong and Yee Peng festivals, inspired by pictures like this one:

As usual, I planned everything at the last moment. After booking my bus tickets for a couple of hours later, I started sending emails to all the Elephant Camps where I could ride an elephant. So, I learnt that there are three kinds of camps:

- The tourist trap, where they put chairs on the elephant's back and they treat them as tools for making money. They even force very old and sick elephants to do it. 

- chair
- old elephant

- The "I still wanna ride an elephant, because #YOLO, but I do not want to hurt him" kind of camp, where your bare-back ride the animal. 

- bare-back riding

- The spa for elephants, where you basically pay to take care of the elephants, but you do not ride them.

- spa for elepanths


I was, as usual, very lucky, because during the Loi Krathong and Yee Peng festivals, Chiang Mai is infested with tourists and all the Elephant Camps are usually fully booked. The only camp who had a free spot for me was the Chai Laid Orchid, and it was perfect, because it was a mix between the bare-back-riding and the spa camps.

I spent the night in the bus and arrived to Chiang Mai early in the morning. The Chai Orchid's driver was waiting for me at the bus station. We were a group of three: an american couple and me. When we arrived to the camp, I saw a couple of elephants with chairs on their backs, and I was thinking "Hey, they lied to me!". But then I met Alexa Pham, Founder of Chai Lai Orchid and Daughters Rising, who explained to me what was going on. The Chai Lai Orchid is a nature retreat nestled in the mountains in Chiang Mai, Thailand. They are a social business that works to promote sustainable tourism, kindness to elephants and helping at-risk women take the first step to get out of poverty and see a future of hope. Actually, they do not own the elephants yet, they are renting them in order to save money to buy them and be able to take care of them. That is why you can still see some of the elephants with chairs on their backs.

We started with a 2-hour trek up in the mountains, which was very nice.

When we came back, we went feeding bananas to the elephants. I was so scared, these beasts can easily kill you with their trunks. One of the young ones got mad at me because I did not have any more bananas and he hit me with his trunk. I did not hurt, but it would have been much less funny if it would have been one of the adults. 

Then the Mahouts, who are people who are assigned an elephant early in their lives and they remain bonded to each other throughout their lives, taught us the basics of how to bare-back ride an elephant. The result was this:

Was it fun? Hell yeah! Would I do it again? Probably not. I still had the feeling that the elephants did not like it. But at the same time, I saw how much they enjoyed playing with their Mahouts, they were like brothers, and they seemed happy when the Mahouts were riding them. Anyway, I am not 100% sure on this, but I would probably not do it again.

When we finished the ride, it was time to care of one of the young elephants, and I can say that this was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. The elephant was so happy that we were taking care of him, you could almost see him smiling! We washed him and brushed him, while his Mahout was feeding him and making him do tricks for us. He was playing with us and even trolling us, using his trunk as a hose to spray water all over us. The most touching part was when he kissed us with his trunk on the cheek to thank us.

We also had some time to talk to Alexa about her projects. I think these videos describe perfectly what she said:



Before leaving the Chai Lai Orchid, we played with a baby elephant and experienced some cuteness overload...


This is the baby elephant that became famous online:


But when I asked "And where is the girl on the video?", they answered "She is at the hospital with dengue, and tomorrow is her birthday...". Next time I will keep my mouth shut... 


Oh, and the Loi Krathong and Yee Peng festivals were very nice:





And Chiang Mai itself was awesome:
